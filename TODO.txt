ensure presentations are in sitemap
think about whether to remove .html from urls (content negotiation, DirectoryIndex)
add meta descriptions for each article/page
tags (also in xml feed)
categories (also in xml feed)
year, month, day pages e.g. /articles/2009/
paginated pages e.g /articles/2009/page/2
pages e.g. /pages/gner-complaint
redirects from old URLs
validate rss
other files - ski videos
navigation e.g. to presentations or blog index pages
favicon
export comments
disqus or equivalent for comments?
or abandon comments?
comments rss
credits e.g. powered by webby, thanks to chris roos, any layout/css stuff
automated deployment
howto publish new blog article
consider adding summaries (include on feeds)
print stylesheet - remove navigation links, sidebar, etc
check in other browsers e.g. IE
png is better, but versions of IE will need gif (content negotiation?)
redirects for presentations to put date at the beginning of the url like articles
