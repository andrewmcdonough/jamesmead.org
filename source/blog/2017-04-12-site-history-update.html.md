In a bid to get back into writing on here, I've just updated the [history of this site][history]:

> In October 2016 I converted this site to use the [Middleman][] static site generator instead of Webby. The latter hadn't been updated in many years and only supported Ruby v1.8. At around the same time I moved the site onto a [Linode][] server and automated deployment from [Github][] via [Travis CI][] using `rsync`.

I felt quite nostalgic looking back at the history of the site and it inspired me to update [that page][history] with with more information about how the hosting, server provisioning and deployment of the site has changed over the years.
